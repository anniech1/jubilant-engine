# Weather Dashboard
## Description
This project utilizes the OpenWeather API in order to display the weather forecast for any city the user enters in. The Dashboard also saves the cities users have searched in local storage, meaning that these cities and their 5-day weather forecast are saved even after the user refreshes the page.
